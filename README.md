The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
![Data Architecture](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=181ztGC1tdmSxFpqjZdogCrAf9AZYMGAo)

- Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
