## 📊 Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
![Data Architecture](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=181ztGC1tdmSxFpqjZdogCrAf9AZYMGAo)

- Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves:

- Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)


### 📌 Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### 📈 BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**
  
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
